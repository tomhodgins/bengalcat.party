  <p>I found George and Gus holding both hands as they napped on the bed, so I carefully picked Jaz up and placed her beside her brothers so I could take some pics. She remained there for a little while, growled a little, relaxed a little, cleaned her paws, and also gave George one warning punch in the face just in case he was thinking about doing anything.</p>
