# Adding Galleries

## Step 1: Load imgur gallery submissions

- https://imgur.com/user/innovati/submitted

## Step 2: Click on desired gallery

## Step 3: Shrink browser zoom to fit all gallery images on screen

## Step 4: Run code in JS console to extract image URLs

[...document.querySelectorAll('.post-image-placeholder')]
  .map(img => img.src)
  .map(src => src.replace(/g.jpg$/m, '.jpg'))

or

[...document.querySelectorAll('.js-post-image-thumb')]
  .map(img => img.src)

or

[...document.querySelectorAll('.post-grid-image')]
  .map(img => `https:${img.dataset.href}`)

## Step 5: Add new gallery object to array below

  {
    title: ``,
    url: ``,
    date: {day: 0, month: 0, year: 2018},
    description: ``,
    keywords: ``,
    images: [],
  },

## Alternate Step 4 & 5: Paste template into JS console and copy object

`
  {
    title: \`${document.querySelector('h1.post-title').innerHTML}\`,
    url: \`${location.href}\`,
    date: {day: ${
